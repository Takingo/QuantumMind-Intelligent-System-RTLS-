- ✅ Main text: "QUANTUM DOOR" (bold, large)
- ✅ Subtitle: "INTELLIGENT" (letter-spaced)
- ✅ Tagline: "QUANTUM MIND INNOVATION"
- ✅ Colors: Teal (#00756F) and cyan (#00FFC6)
- ✅ Background: Dark gradient

**Removed:**

---

## 📂 What Was Changed

### File Modified:
**`lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`**
- Logo section: Changed from old logo to Quantum Door design
- Text section: Updated to "QUANTUM DOOR INTELLIGENT"
- Colors: Applied your brand colors (teal #00756F)
- Fallback: Shows door icon if image file not found

### Logo Path:
The app looks for: `assets/logo/quantum_door_logo.png`

**If file exists** → Shows your actual logo image  
**If file missing** → Shows fallback design (door icon + border)

Both options look professional and match your brand!

---

## 🚀 How to Add Your Logo Image (Optional)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo
- Save as PNG format
- Size: 1024x1024 px (square)
- Transparent background recommended
- Should show:
  - Door in center
  - Circular headphones/border
  - Sound waves on sides
  - Network nodes at bottom

### Step 2: Add to Project
Copy to: `C:\Users\posei\QuantumMind_RTLS\assets\logo\quantum_door_logo.png`

### Step 3: Rebuild
```batch
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d <your-device>
```

---

## ✅ Current Status

**Fallback Design Active:**
- Shows door icon (sensor_door)
- Circular teal border (#00756F)
- Hub/network icon below
- Your brand colors applied
- Looks professional!

**This means:**
- ✅ No action needed if you like the fallback design
- ✅ Or add your actual logo image file later
- ✅ App works perfectly either way

---

```batch
flutter run -d <your-device-name>
```

You'll see:
1. App opens
