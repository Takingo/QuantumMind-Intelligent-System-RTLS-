### 3. Backup Creation

Created a backup of the original corrupted file:
- `lib/screens/advanced_rtls_map_screen_backup_final.dart`

## Benefits

1. **Better Visualization**: All elements now show with proper icons and labels instead of small dots
2. **Improved Visibility**: Measurement and Background sections are now clearly visible with enhanced styling
3. **Enhanced UX**: Better spacing, sizing, and visual hierarchy make the interface more intuitive
4. **Consistent Design**: All UI elements follow a consistent design language with proper shadows, borders, and spacing
5. **Better Readability**: Increased font sizes and improved contrast make text easier to read
6. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing functionality is preserved while improving the visual presentation

## Testing

The improvements have been implemented and tested to ensure:
- All element types display properly with icons and labels
- Measurement and Background sections are clearly visible
- All existing functionality (selection, editing, dragging) works as expected
- UI/UX improvements enhance the overall user experience
- No breaking changes to existing code functionality
