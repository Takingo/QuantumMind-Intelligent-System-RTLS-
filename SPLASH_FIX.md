# 🔧 SPLASH SCREEN FIX

## Issues Fixed:

1. ✅ Added error handling for logo loading
2. ✅ Added fallback icon if logo fails
3. ✅ Added debug prints to track navigation
4. ✅ Logo will show (either your image or fallback)

## 🚀 How to Test:

### Step 1: Hot Restart
If app is running, press `R` (capital R) in terminal

### Step 2: Fresh Run
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d android
```

## 📱 What Should Happen:

### Splash Screen (3 seconds):
1. **Logo appears** (your brain logo or fallback icon)
2. **Particles animate** around it
3. **Text fades in**: "QuantumMind" + "Intelligent UWB System"
4. **Progress indicator** spins
5. **After 3 seconds** → Navigates to Login

### Check Terminal Output:
You should see:
```
🚀 Navigating from splash screen...
📱 Is logged in: false
✅ Navigation completed
```

## 🐛 If Still Stuck:

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check terminal** for error messages
2. **Look for** asset loading errors
3. **Verify** logo file exists: `assets/logo/Quantum Mind Logo 2.png`

### Manual Test:
```bash
# Check if file exists
dir "assets\logo\Quantum Mind Logo 2.png"
```

## 💡 Fallback Behavior:

If logo image fails to load:
- ✅ Shows gradient icon instead
- ✅ App still works perfectly
- ✅ Navigation still happens after 3 seconds

## ⚠️ Common Issues:

1. **Logo not showing** → Check pubspec.yaml has `- assets/logo/`
2. **Stuck on splash** → Check terminal for navigation logs
3. **White screen** → Asset path might be wrong

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:

**Timeline:**
- 0s: Splash appears with logo
- 0.5s: Logo fully visible
- 0.8s: Text fades in
- 3.0s: Navigate to login screen ← **THIS SHOULD HAPPEN!**

**Try running now and check terminal output!**
