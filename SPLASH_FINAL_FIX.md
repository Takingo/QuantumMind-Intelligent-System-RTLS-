# 🔧 SPLASH SCREEN FIX - FINAL SOLUTION

## ⚠️ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:

The app is running with OLD cached version. You need to COMPLETELY RESTART.

## ✅ SOLUTION - DO THIS EXACTLY:

### Option 1: Use the Batch File (EASIEST)

1. **Stop the current app** (press `q` in terminal)
2. **Double-click**: `RESTART_APP.bat`
3. **Wait** for it to complete

### Option 2: Manual Steps

**In your terminal:**

```bash
# 1. Stop app (press 'q')

# 2. Force stop on device
adb shell am force-stop com.example.quantummind_rtls

# 3. Clean everything
flutter clean

# 4. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 5. Run fresh
flutter run -d android
```

## 📱 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:

### Splash Screen (2 seconds):
- ✅ Your QuantumMind logo (180x180)
- ✅ Gradient "QuantumMind" text
- ✅ "Intelligent UWB System" subtitle
- ✅ Cyan loading spinner
- ✅ Fade-in animation
- ✅ **AUTO-NAVIGATES to Login after 2 seconds**

### Dashboard Title:
- ✅ Now shows: **"Quantum Mind UWB Intelligent System"**

## 🎯 VERIFICATION:

After restart, you should see:
1. ✅ **Splash screen appears** (with logo)
2. ✅ Wait 2 seconds
3. ✅ Smooth fade to login screen
4. ✅ Login with `test@1.com` / `123456`
5. ✅ Dashboard shows new title

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

**HOT RELOAD (`r`) WILL NOT WORK** for splash screen!

You MUST do **FULL RESTART** when changing:
- App entry point
- Splash screen
- Routes

## 🔍 DEBUG:

If splash still doesn't show, check terminal for:
```
Error: Unable to load asset: assets/logo/Quantum Mind Logo 2.png
```

If you see this, the logo file might have wrong name/location.
