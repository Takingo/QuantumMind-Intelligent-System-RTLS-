5. Anchor appears on map
6. Drag to exact position

### **Anchor Appearance:**
- **Red router icon** (🔴📡)
- Red glow effect (visible from far)
- **ID label below** (e.g., "A001")
- 50x50 pixels
- Yellow border when selected

### **Tap Anchor to See Details:**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

```dart
1. User taps "Wall" button → _drawingMode = wall
2. User taps map → _wallStartPoint = position
3. Red dot appears at start point
4. User taps second point → Create MapWall(x1, y1, x2, y2)
5. Wall painted with WallPainter (thick grey line)
6. Reset _wallStartPoint = null
```

### **Door Painter:**
```dart
Custom paint with:
- Door frame (brown rectangle)
- Left panel (brown fill)
- Right panel (brown fill)
- Yellow door handles (2 circles)
- Border changes color when selected
```

### **Anchor Model:**
```dart
class MapAnchor extends MapElement {
  String id;        // e.g., "A001"
  String name;      // e.g., "North Corner"
  double x, y;      // Position coordinates
}
```

### **PDF Export:**
```dart
Uses: pdf package (pw.Document)
Creates: A4 page with map summary
Includes: All element lists + details
Saves to: App documents directory
Format: rtls_map_[timestamp].pdf
```

### **Floor Plan Import:**
```dart
Uses: image_picker package
Accepts: PNG, JPG, JPEG
Loads: As Uint8List (bytes)
Displays: Image.memory() as background
Overlay: All map elements on top
```
