## 📱 Android Device Setup

### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode

1. **Go to Settings** → About Phone
2. **Tap "Build Number" 7 times**
3. You'll see "You are now a developer!"

### Step 2: Enable USB Debugging

1. **Go to Settings** → Developer Options
2. **Enable "USB Debugging"**
3. **Enable "Install via USB"** (optional, helpful)

### Step 3: Connect Phone

1. **Connect phone to PC via USB cable**
2. **On phone**: Allow USB debugging popup
3. **Select "Always allow from this computer"**

### Step 4: Verify Connection

```bash
flutter devices
```

You should see something like:
```
Samsung Galaxy S21 (mobile) • 1234567890 • android-arm64 • Android 13
```

### Step 5: Run App

```bash
cd "c:\Users\posei\QuantumMind Intelligent System & RTLS Live Tracking"
flutter run -d android
```

**Or just:**
```bash
run_device.bat
```

## 🍎 iOS Device Setup (macOS only)

### Requirements
- macOS computer
- Xcode installed
- Apple Developer Account (free tier OK)

### Steps

1. **Connect iPhone/iPad via USB**
2. **Trust computer on device**
3. **In Xcode**: Add your Apple ID (Preferences → Accounts)

```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

⚠️ **Note**: iOS development requires macOS. Windows cannot build for iOS.

## 🤖 Android Emulator (No physical device needed)

### Step 1: Install Android Studio

Download: https://developer.android.com/studio

### Step 2: Create Virtual Device

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Tools** → **Device Manager**
3. **Create Virtual Device**
4. **Select phone model** (e.g., Pixel 6)
5. **Download system image** (e.g., Android 13)
6. **Finish**

### Step 3: Start Emulator

Click ▶️ play button on your virtual device

### Step 4: Run App

```bash
flutter run
```

Flutter will automatically detect the emulator!

## 📦 Build APK for Sharing

### Option 1: Release APK (Recommended)

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

**Output:** `build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`

**Size:** ~20-30 MB

**Use for:**
- Sharing with friends/colleagues
- Testing on multiple devices
- Distribution (not Google Play)

### Option 2: Debug APK (Faster build)

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

**Output:** `build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`

**Size:** ~40-50 MB (larger)

### Option 3: Split APKs (Smaller size)

```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

Creates separate APKs for different CPU architectures:
- `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (older phones)
- `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (modern phones) ⭐
- `app-x86_64-release.apk` (emulators)

**Choose arm64-v8a for most modern phones!**

## 🔧 Common Commands

```bash
# Check connected devices
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Run on all connected devices
flutter run -d all

# Build APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle (for Google Play)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Install on connected device
flutter install

# Uninstall from device
adb uninstall com.quantummind.rtls

# Check device logs
flutter logs

# Run in release mode (faster)
flutter run --release
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No devices found"

**Android:**
```bash
# Check ADB
adb devices

# If empty, try:
adb kill-server
adb start-server

# Then:
flutter devices
```

**Make sure:**
- USB Debugging is enabled
- USB cable is data cable (not charge-only)
- Phone is unlocked
- You allowed USB debugging popup

### "Device unauthorized"

On phone: Tap "Always allow" on USB debugging prompt

### "Gradle build failed"

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### App crashes on start

Check logs:
```bash
flutter logs
```

or

```bash
adb logcat
```

### "Insufficient storage"

Free up space on phone or build with:
```bash
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```
