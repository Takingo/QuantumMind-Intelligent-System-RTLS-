# üö® SPLASH SCREEN DISABLED - DIRECT TO LOGIN

## What I Did:

‚ùå **COMPLETELY BYPASSED** the splash screen
‚úÖ **APP NOW GOES DIRECTLY** to login screen

## Why:

The splash screen was causing navigation issues. By removing it completely, the app will now:

1. Start up
2. Go DIRECTLY to login screen
3. NO waiting, NO stuck screen

## Run Now:

```bash
flutter run -d android
```

## What Will Happen:

‚úÖ App opens
‚úÖ **IMMEDIATELY shows login screen**
‚úÖ Enter: `test@1.com` / `123456`
‚úÖ Go to dashboard

## After Testing:

Once you confirm the app works WITHOUT splash screen, I can:
1. Add a simple splash back (without particles)
2. Or keep it direct to login
3. Your choice!
