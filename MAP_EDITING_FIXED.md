# ✅ Map Editing Complete Fix - All Elements Now Editable

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Previously, you could add distances between areas (zones) but **couldn't edit them afterwards**. Additionally, some map elements were not fully editable.

## ✨ What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Walls - Now Fully Editable** 🧱
- **Before**: Could only view wall info, couldn't edit
- **After**: 
  - ✅ Double-click wall → Edit dialog with X1, Y1, X2, Y2 coordinates
  - ✅ Drag blue/red endpoint handles in edit mode
  - ✅ Live length calculation in real units (m/cm/ft)
  - ✅ Visual feedback with blue (start) and red (end) drag handles

### 2. **Distance Lines Between Zones - NEW FEATURE** 📏
- **NEW Tool Added**: "Distance" button in drawing tools (yellow with ruler icon)

  1. Enable Edit Mode (✏️ icon in app bar)
  2. Click "Distance" tool (yellow ruler icon)
  3. Click first zone → Shows "First zone selected" message
  4. Click second zone → Creates distance line
  5. Double-click distance line → Edit custom label
  6. Click distance line + Delete → Remove measurement

- **Features**:
  - ✅ Automatically calculates distance between zone centers
  - ✅ Shows distance in configured unit (meters/cm/feet)
  - ✅ Custom label support (optional)
  - ✅ Yellow dashed line with measurement badge
  - ✅ Editable via double-click
  - ✅ Deletable when selected

### 3. **All Other Elements - Already Editable** ✅
- **Zones**: Double-click → Edit name, width, height, color
- **Doors**: Double-click → Edit name, drag to move
- **Anchors**: Double-click → Edit ID and name, drag to move
- **Tags** (Workers/Vehicles/Equipment/Assets): Double-click → Edit ID and name, drag to move

## 🎨 Visual Improvements
